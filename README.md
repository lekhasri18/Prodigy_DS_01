Population Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains scripts for analyzing and visualizing population data from the World Bank dataset. The dataset used is "API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_excel_v2_203.xls", which provides comprehensive population data for various countries over several decades.
Features
1. Distribution of Population by Country in 2023

This script generates a histogram to visualize the distribution of the population across countries in 2023. It provides insights into how population sizes vary globally.

    Script: population_distribution_2023.py
    Visualization: Histogram with logarithmic scale

2. Population of India from 1960 to 2022

This script creates a bar chart to visualize the population trend of India from 1960 to 2022. It highlights the population growth over the years.

    Script: population_india_1960_2022.py
    Visualization: Bar chart

3. Population Comparison of Multiple Countries in 2023

This script compares the population of selected countries (Italy, India, United States, China, and Japan) for the year 2023. It helps in understanding the population sizes of these major countries.

    Visualization: Bar chart

4. Population Growth Over Time for Multiple Countries

This script generates histograms to show the population distribution over the years (1960-2022) for selected countries. It provides a comparative view of population growth trends.

    Script: population_growth_comparison.py
    Visualization: Histograms

5. Population Distribution Analysis of Selected Countries (1960-2022)

This script provides a detailed histogram analysis of population distribution for selected countries from 1960 to 2022. Each countryâ€™s data is plotted separately.

    Script: population_distribution_selected_countries.py
    Visualization: Subplots with histograms

6. Population Trend of a Single Country

This script plots the population trend of a single country (e.g., India) from 1960 to 2022. It highlights the changes in population over time with a line plot.

    Script: population_trend_single_country.py
    Visualization: Line plot

7. Population Comparison Using Boxplot

This script uses boxplots to compare the population distribution of selected countries from 1960 to 2022. It provides a statistical overview of population data.

    Script: population_comparison_boxplot.py
    Visualization: Boxplots

8. Population Distribution by Continent in 2023

This script aggregates population data by continent for the year 2023 and visualizes it using a bar chart. It provides a macro-level view of population distribution across continents.

    Script: population_distribution_by_continent_2023.py
    Visualization: Bar chart
